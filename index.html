      Few years ago, I started learning code on my own through watching online website, you tube or taking short term
      course.And, one day a nice couple who is programming recommended me to enrol Bootcamp online course. It helps me
      to
      explore more about coding knowledge with professional ways.
      My target is being a web developer and I cannot stop coding which is very meaningful and it is part of our life.
